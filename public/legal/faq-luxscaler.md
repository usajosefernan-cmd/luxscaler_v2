# FAQ - LuxScaler

## General Questions

### What is LuxScaler?

LuxScaler is an **AI-powered image upscaling and enhancement service** that helps you transform your photos and graphics into stunning high-resolution versions. Using advanced artificial intelligence, we analyze and enhance your images to create multiple creative variations and then generate final outputs at up to 8K resolution.

### How does LuxScaler work?

**Three-step process:**

1. **Upload & Analysis:** You upload your image, and our AI analyzes the content to identify the best enhancement approach
2. **Preview Generation:** AI creates multiple creative variations with different artistic interpretations (lighting, textures, details)
3. **High-Resolution Output:** You select a preview you like, and we generate the final 4K/8K version

The entire process typically takes 30-120 seconds depending on image size and resolution.

### What file formats do you support?

**Input formats:**
- JPEG
- PNG
- WebP
- TIFF

**Output formats:**
- JPEG (standard quality)
- PNG (lossless)
- WebP (optimized)

**File size limits:**
- Max upload: 50MB
- Large files are automatically optimized before processing

### Can I generate multiple variations?

**Yes!** Our preview generation creates **6 different creative variations** by default:
- Different artistic interpretations
- Varying lighting and color treatments
- Multiple texture and detail enhancements
- Creative and style options

You can regenerate unlimited times to find the perfect variation.

## AI Enhancement & Results

### Will the 4K output match my chosen preview exactly?

**Honest answer: No, probably not perfectly.**

The preview and final 4K output use different AI processes and resolutions. Typical differences:

- **Color:** ±5-15% variation in hue, saturation, brightness
- **Details:** New textures or details may appear at higher resolution
- **Facial features:** ±5-10% variation in facial structure, skin tone, expression
- **Overall appearance:** ±10-20% creative difference

**This is intentional.** The AI interprets your image creatively, which is what makes the enhancement powerful. It's not a "photoshop filter"—it's intelligent enhancement.

**What you can do:**
- Generate 4K multiple times (each attempt is different)
- Choose the variation you like best
- Request refund if output is completely unusable (see Refunds below)

### What exactly does "creative upscaling" mean?

Traditional upscaling just enlarges pixels. **Creative upscaling:**
- Analyzes what your image should look like
- Adds realistic details and textures
- Enhances lighting and colors
- Improves clarity and definition
- May change materials and surfaces for realism

**Example:** A low-res CGI render might become more photo-realistic with added detail, texture, and subtle imperfections that make it look authentic.

### Why does my image look different from the preview?

**Reasons for differences:**

1. **Different AI processing:** Preview uses one AI generation, 4K uses another
2. **Resolution scaling:** More detail visible at 4K may be interpreted differently
3. **Creative interpretation:** AI may enhance differently at higher resolutions
4. **Random elements:** AI uses probabilistic sampling (not deterministic)
5. **Hallucination:** AI may create new details that weren't in preview

**This is normal and documented in our Terms of Service (Section 4.3).**

### Can I use the preview as my final output?

**No.** Previews are:
- Lower resolution (usually 1024x768 or similar)
- Compressed for quick generation
- Not suitable for printing or professional use
- Just a "taste" of what the final will look like

You must generate the 4K/8K final version for any serious use.

### Will AI change my face/facial features?

**Possibly, yes.** Our AI may:
- Smooth or sharpen skin texture
- Change skin tone or lighting on face
- Slightly alter facial proportions (±5-10%)
- Modify expressions or eye openness
- Add or remove makeup appearance
- Change apparent age

**We call this "Identity Preservation"** but it's NOT perfect. If exact facial accuracy is critical (professional headshots, ID photos), we recommend:

1. Generate multiple times and pick best result
2. Use original photo for official purposes
3. Only use LuxScaler outputs for creative/artistic use

### What if AI generates inappropriate content?

**Our safety measures:**
- Built-in AI filters prevent most inappropriate content
- However, filters aren't perfect (false negatives happen)

**If inappropriate content is generated:**
1. Delete it (don't share or use it)
2. Report it to us: support@luxscaler.com
3. We'll investigate and improve our filters
4. **You are responsible for reviewing outputs before use**

**Important:** We are NOT liable for inappropriate AI outputs. See Terms of Service Section 4.5.

### Can I use AI outputs commercially?

**Yes, but with caveats:**

**You can use for:**
- Website graphics
- Marketing materials
- Product photos
- Social media content
- Commercial projects

**But you must:**
- Review for accuracy and appropriateness first
- Verify no copyright infringement (see below)
- Disclose AI enhancement if required by platforms
- Test quality before using in production

**We recommend:** For high-stakes commercial use (product photos, professional headshots), test with smaller projects first.

### Will AI outputs infringe copyright?

**Possible, but not likely in most cases.**

**Context:**
- AI models are trained on billions of images
- Some training data may be copyrighted
- AI outputs MIGHT incorporate patterns from training data
- This is a developing legal area

**What we do:**
- We don't use your images to train models
- We don't claim to provide copyright-free outputs
- You must verify outputs for your specific use

**What you must do:**
- For critical commercial use, review carefully
- Consider copyright insurance if using at scale
- Don't explicitly request "copy this artist's style"
- Use for personal/creative purposes where risk is lower

**See Terms of Service Section 5.2 for full details.**

## Upscaling & Resolution

### What's the difference between 4K and 8K?

| Resolution | Dimensions | Use Cases | File Size |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **4K** | ~3840×2160 | Displays, social media, web, printing (A3) | 8-20MB JPEG |
| **8K** | ~7680×4320 | Large prints, professional displays, future-proofing | 20-50MB JPEG |

**Most users need 4K.** 8K is for printing large (A2, A1) or professional archival.

### Will the 4K/8K be exact resolution?

**Not always.** 

We aim for target resolutions, but:
- May vary ±20% in actual dimensions
- Depends on AI capabilities and input image
- Aspect ratios may be adjusted slightly
- Output dimensions may be rounded for optimization

**See Terms of Service Section 4.4 for technical details.**

### How long does it take to generate?

**Typical times:**
- Preview generation: 15-30 seconds (6 variations)
- 4K generation: 30-90 seconds
- 8K generation: 60-120 seconds

Times vary based on:
- Image size and complexity
- Server load
- Your subscription tier

### Why is my generation taking so long?

**Possible reasons:**
- **Large input image:** Images >20MB are optimized first
- **High resolution:** 8K takes longer than 4K
- **Server load:** Peak times (evening) may be slower
- **Complex image:** Detailed images take longer to process

**Typical wait:** Most generations complete within 2 minutes. If longer than 10 minutes, generation likely failed—check your account.

### Can I cancel a generation?

**Yes.** If a generation is taking too long:
1. Click "Cancel" on the generation card
2. Credits will be refunded
3. You can retry immediately

## Technical & Troubleshooting

### What if my image fails to upload?

**Try:**
1. Check file size (<50MB)
2. Check file format (JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF)
3. Check internet connection
4. Refresh page and retry
5. Try different browser

**Still not working?** Contact support@luxscaler.com

### Why does my image look blurry?

**Possible causes:**
1. **Original was blurry:** AI can't fix blur perfectly
2. **Compression:** Large files are optimized (may lose detail)
3. **AI interpretation:** AI may smooth over fine details for realism
4. **Download:** File may have been compressed during download

**Try:**
- Upload original high-quality image
- Use PNG instead of JPEG
- Generate multiple times
- Request support if persistent

### Why is the file size so large?

**4K/8K files are inherently large:**
- 4K JPEG: 8-20MB
- 4K PNG: 30-100MB
- 8K JPEG: 20-50MB
- 8K PNG: 100-300MB

**To reduce:**
- Download as JPEG instead of PNG
- Use WebP format (smallest)
- Compress after download

### Can I batch process multiple images?

**Not yet**, but it's on our roadmap.

Currently: One image at a time.

**Workaround:**
- Process multiple images in sequence
- Bulk pricing available for high-volume users—contact sales

### What if service is down?

**We aim for 99.9% uptime** but:
