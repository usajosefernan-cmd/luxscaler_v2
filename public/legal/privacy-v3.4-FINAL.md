## AI Processing & Third-Party Services

### Third-Party AI Providers

**LuxScaler uses third-party artificial intelligence services** to process your images. This is core to how the service works.

**When you upload an image:**

1. **Your image is sent to third-party AI providers** via API
2. **Processing occurs on their servers** (not our servers)
3. **AI analyzes and generates new images** based on your input
4. **Results are returned to us** and stored in our system
5. **AI providers may log requests temporarily** for their security and operational purposes

**What data leaves our servers:**
- ✓ Your uploaded images (full resolution or compressed)
- ✓ Image metadata (dimensions, format)
- ✓ Processing settings
- ✓ System prompts (our instructions to AI)
- ✗ NOT your account info (email, name, payment data)
- ✗ NOT your IP address or personal identifiers

**What AI providers may retain:**
- Processing logs (typically 30-90 days)
- Error logs and diagnostics
- Security and abuse detection data
- Exact retention periods are controlled by third parties (outside our control)

### Important Limitations

**⚠️ WE DO NOT CONTROL THIRD-PARTY AI PROVIDERS**

**We cannot guarantee:**
- ✗ That AI providers comply with all GDPR requirements
- ✗ EU-only data residency (processing may occur internationally)
- ✗ Specific retention periods (providers control their logs)
- ✗ That AI providers won't change their policies
- ✗ That AI providers are immune to data breaches

**We use reputable providers but:**
- They operate under their own privacy policies
- They may be subject to foreign laws
- They may be compelled to disclose data to governments
- We have limited contractual control over their data handling

**What we DO:**
- ✓ Select providers with strong security and privacy practices
- ✓ Use encrypted connections (TLS/HTTPS)
- ✓ Minimize data sent (only necessary image and settings)
- ✓ Don't send your personal info (email, payment data) to AI providers
- ✓ Monitor provider compliance and switch if needed

### Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

**For EU users:**

Most third-party AI providers we use:
- Do NOT offer signed Data Processing Agreements (DPA) to indirect customers
- Do NOT guarantee EU-only data residency
- Operate primarily from the United States

**What this means for you:**
- Your data may be processed internationally without full GDPR protections
- We rely on your consent for international data transfers (see below)
- You accept this risk by using the Service
- If you need strict EU-only processing, we recommend considering alternative services

### AI Training & Your Content

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:**

**Your images are NOT used to train AI models.**

- ✓ We do NOT send your images to AI training pipelines
- ✓ AI providers state they don't use API customer data for training
- ✓ Your images are processed in real-time and discarded by AI providers

**However:**
- ⚠️ AI models were ALREADY trained on billions of images (before you used the service)
- ⚠️ Those training datasets MAY include copyrighted content, public photos
- ⚠️ AI outputs MAY incorporate patterns learned from training data
- ⚠️ We have NO control over what data was used to train AI models

**This means:**
- Your specific images don't affect AI training
- But AI was trained on data that may raise copyright concerns
- AI outputs may resemble training data (see Terms of Service)

---

## Other Third-Party Services

We work with trusted service providers for:

**Cloud Hosting & Infrastructure:**
- Database, storage, authentication, serverless functions
- CDN, DDoS protection, caching

**Payment Processing:**
- Credit card processing
- Alternative payment methods
- PCI-DSS certified providers

**Email Communications:**
- Transactional emails (account confirmations, receipts)

**Analytics & Performance:**
- Website traffic analysis (anonymized IP, optional, requires consent)
- Error tracking and debugging (anonymized, essential for service quality)

**Authentication (Optional):**
- Third-party OAuth sign-in (only if you choose this option)

**Data Transfers:**
Your data may be processed in countries outside the European Economic Area, including the **United States**. We implement appropriate safeguards:
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with processors where available
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Contractual data protection commitments
- Regular security audits

## International Transfers

LuxScaler is operated from **Spain (European Union)**.

**Where your data goes:**

| Data Type | Typical Destinations | Safeguards | Legal Basis |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Images (AI processing)** | United States, other international locations | TLS encryption, limited retention | Consent |
| **Account data** | European Union (primary) | GDPR compliant infrastructure | Contract |
| **Payment data** | United States, EU | SCCs, PCI-DSS certified | Contract |
| **Analytics** | Various (anonymized) | Anonymized, consent-based | Consent |
| **Backups** | EU + international (redundancy) | Encrypted, access controls | Legitimate interest |

**Important:**
- AI service providers are typically located in the **United States** or other international locations
- Many countries do NOT have adequacy decisions from EU Commission
- Some countries have laws requiring government access to data
- We CANNOT prevent government access to your images if legally compelled in those jurisdictions

**Your rights:**
- ✓ You consent to international transfers by using the Service
- ✓ You can withdraw consent anytime (but can't use AI features without processing)
- ✓ You can request data deletion (will remove from our systems and request deletion from processors)

**Alternatives if you need EU-only processing:**
- EU-based AI services (may be more expensive/limited)
- Self-hosted AI models (requires technical expertise)
- Services with EU data residency guarantees

---

## AI-Generated Content & Risks

### What You Should Know

**AI outputs may contain:**
- ✗ **Inappropriate content:** Despite safety filters, AI may occasionally generate inappropriate content
- ✗ **Inaccuracies:** Colors, details, faces may differ from original or preview
- ✗ **IP concerns:** Outputs may incorporate patterns from copyrighted training data
- ✗ **Biases:** AI models may exhibit various biases
- ✗ **Privacy concerns:** AI might "remember" patterns from training data (though NOT your specific images)

**Your responsibility:**
- ✓ Review all outputs before use, especially commercial or public use
- ✓ Delete and report any inappropriate outputs
- ✓ Verify accuracy for critical applications
- ✓ Ensure legal compliance (no copyright infringement, false advertising, etc.)

**Our limitations:**
- ✗ We do NOT manually review every generated image
- ✗ We CANNOT prevent all inappropriate outputs
- ✗ We do NOT guarantee outputs are copyright-free
- ✗ We are NOT LIABLE for issues arising from AI outputs (see Terms of Service)
