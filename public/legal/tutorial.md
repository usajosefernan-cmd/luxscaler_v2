# LuxScaler Tutorial & Best Practices

## Get Maximum Quality 4K/8K Upscales in 3 Steps

---

## 1. Getting Started

### What is LuxScaler?

LuxScaler is an **AI-powered image enhancement platform** that intelligently analyzes your image type to provide professional upscaling and creative variations.

* **Preview:** Fast, 6 parallel AI styles (30s).
* **Master:** Final 4K/8K ultra-high-quality output.
* **Creativity:** Controls how much the AI reinterprets the original.
* **Fractality:** Controls the level of high-frequency detail.

## 2. The LuxScaler Workflow

### Step 1: Upload (AI Forensics)

Your image is analyzed by our Vision AI to detect lighting, lens distortion, and quality issues.

* **Best Practice:** Always use the original source. Avoid images that are already heavily compressed.

### Step 2: Compare 6 Previews

LuxScaler generates 6 distinct interpretations:

1. **Forensic Recovery:** Fixes damage, blur, and noise.
2. **Balanced Polish:** Professional, clean, commercial look.
3. **Trend:** Artistic styles currently popular in cinematography.
4. **Studio Lighting:** Adds virtual professional lighting.
5. **Creative Reality:** Adds realistic textures and depth.
6. **Max Sharpness:** Maximum clarity for architectural or product shots.

### Step 3: Pick & Render Master

Select your favorite preview. It becomes the "Style Reference" for the final render. LuxScaler then reconstructs the image at native 4K or 8K resolution.

## 3. Optimization by Image Type

| Category | Creativity | Fractality | Recommended Preset |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Portraits** | 2-4 | 6-7 | Studio Lighting / Balanced |
| **Landscapes** | 5-7 | 8-9 | Creative Reality / Sharpness |
| **Products** | 4-6 | 9-10 | Balanced / Max Sharpness |
| **Food** | 3-5 | 7-8 | Trend / Balanced Polish |
| **Architecture** | 5-7 | 8-9 | Max Sharpness / Balanced |
| **Text/Logos** | 0-1 | 4-5 | Forensic Recovery (LOCKED) |

## 4. Advanced Settings Explained

### Creativity (0-10)

* **Low (0-4):** Preserves identity. Best for portraits and documents.
* **Medium (5-7):** Professional enhancement. Best for nature and products.
* **High (8-10):** Artistic freedom. AI "paints" new details.

### Fractality (0-10)

* **Low (0-4):** Soft, painterly, flattering (good for smoothing skin).
* **High (7-10):** Hyper-realistic, every pore and grain visible.

### Light & Color Boost

* **Light Boost:** Reveals detail in shadows. Use +1 to +3 for dark selfies.
* **Color Boost:** Makes landscapes pop. Use +2 for vibrant nature shots.

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Face looks different in 4K?

Reduce **Creativity** to 2-4 and use **Balanced Polish**. Portraits require identity preservation.

### Image looks blurry?

Increase **Fractality** to 7-9 and ensure you are downloading the **Master 4K/8K**, not the preview.

### Can I use it commercially?

Yes. You own all rights to the generated outputs. See our Terms of Service for full details.
