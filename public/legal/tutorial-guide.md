## 🚀 Getting Started

### What is LuxScaler?

LuxScaler is an **AI-powered image enhancement platform** that:
- 📸 **Upscales** images to 4K/8K resolution
- 🎨 **Enhances** quality, clarity, and color
- 🧠 **Intelligently analyzes** your image type
- ⚡ **Generates 6 variations** in seconds (Preview mode)
- 💎 **Produces 4K masterpieces** (Master mode)

### Key Concepts

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Preview** | Fast, low-res preview of 6 AI enhancement styles (30 seconds) |
| **Master** | Final 4K/8K ultra-high-quality output (15-45 seconds) |
| **Creativity** | How much the AI "reimagines" vs "preserves" your original |
| **Fractality** | Detail sharpness level (0=soft, 10=hyper-sharp) |
| **Settings** | Sliders that control the AI's enhancement direction |

---

## 🔄 The LuxScaler Workflow

### Step 1: Upload Your Image ⬆️

**What happens internally:**
- Your image is analyzed by LuxScaler's Vision AI
- Format: JPEG, PNG (max 4MB)
- Resolution: Any (even tiny phone photos)

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Use original/highest quality source available
- ✅ Ensure good lighting (if possible)
- ✅ Portrait: Face clearly visible
- ✅ Landscape: Sharp focus on main subject
- ❌ Avoid: Already heavily compressed images

### Step 2: See 6 Preview Variations 🎬

**What happens:**
1. **Vision Analysis (AI Forensics):** LuxScaler automatically detects:
   - Image type (portrait, landscape, product, architecture, etc.)
   - Quality issues (blur, noise, low contrast)
   - Lighting conditions
   - Camera type/lens used

2. **AI Generation (6 Parallel Styles):**
   - **Forensic Recovery**: Fixes damage, blur, noise
   - **Balanced Polish**: Professional commercial look
   - **Trend**: Current popular style (e.g., "Cinematic Teal")
   - **Studio Lighting**: Adds professional studio lights
   - **Creative Reality**: Adds realistic details
   - **Max Sharpness**: Ultra-detailed, hyper-clean

3. **You See All 6:** Compare instantly, choose your favorite

**Best practice:**
- Look at all 6, not just the first
- Read descriptions (e.g., "Best for portraits" vs "Best for landscapes")
- Each variation shows different creative directions

### Step 3: Pick Your Favorite & Upscale to 4K 👑

**What happens:**
- Your chosen preview is used as a **style reference**
- Original image is upscaled while **preserving identity**
- Master Sculptor AI generates native 4K/8K output
- Takes 15-45 seconds depending on resolution

**Your choice matters:**
- "Balanced Polish" = Commercial, professional
- "Studio Lighting" = Portrait-ready, studio-quality
- "Creative Reality" = More artistic, dramatic

## 🎨 Optimization Guide by Image Type

### 1️⃣ PORTRAITS (Faces, Selfies, Headshots)

**Best Settings:**
- **Creativity:** 2-4 (Keep face identity very stable)
- **Fractality:** 6-7 (Show skin texture, details)
- **Light Boost:** +2 to +3 (Brighten eyes, reduce shadows)

**Why:**
- LuxScaler **locks identity** for human faces (±5-10% variation only)
- Fractality shows skin pores/texture (professional look)
- Light boost reveals subtle facial details

**Pro tip:**
- Use "Studio Lighting" preview if face is dark/shadowed
- Use "Balanced Polish" for professional headshots
- Avoid "Max Sharpness" (can look artificial on faces)

**Expected result:**
- Crystal clear skin texture
- Brighter, more engaging eyes
- Professional headshot quality

---

### 2️⃣ LANDSCAPES (Nature, Scenery, Travel Photos)

**Best Settings:**
- **Creativity:** 5-7 (Can enhance scenery details)
- **Fractality:** 8-9 (Show every leaf, rock, cloud)
- **Color Boost:** +2 to +4 (Richer, more vibrant)

**Why:**
- Landscapes benefit from detail injection
- High fractality shows texture of nature
- Color boost makes sunsets pop

**Pro tip:**

- Use "Studio Lighting" if building is poorly lit

**Expected result:**
- Crisp, professional building shots
- Every architectural detail visible
- Perfect for real estate listings or portfolios

---

### 6️⃣ GRAPHICS & TEXT (Screenshots, Documents, Logos)

**Best Settings:**
- **Creativity:** 0-1 (LOCKED - No changes to text/characters)
- **Fractality:** 4-5 (Slight sharpness boost only)
- **No changes to content**

**Why:**
- LuxScaler prevents text hallucination (creates wrong characters)
- Only cleans up visual quality, doesn't add content
- Safe for screenshots and documents

**Pro tip:**
- Use "Forensic Recovery" to clean noise
- Don't expect text reconstruction (that's OCR, not upscaling)
- Perfect for website screenshots, document preservation

**Expected result:**
- Cleaner, sharper text
- Better contrast between letters
- No AI-invented characters

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "My face looks different in the 4K output"

**Why it happens:**
- Creativity was set too high (>5)
- AI emphasized facial features

**Solution:**
- Use **Creativity 2-4** for portraits
- Choose preview that matches your face best
- Use "Balanced Polish" preset (conservative style)

---

### Issue 2: "The image is too blurry/soft"

**Why it happens:**
- Fractality was set too low (<4)
- Original image was very low resolution

**Solution:**
- Increase **Fractality to 7-8**
- Use "Max Sharpness" preview
- Try "Forensic Recovery" if original is damaged

---

### Issue 3: "Colors look oversaturated/fake"

**Why it happens:**
- Color Boost was set too high (>+4)
- Image was already color-graded

**Solution:**
- Reduce **Color Boost to +2 or 0**
- Use "Balanced Polish" (conservative color)
- Use "Trend" if you want artistic colors

---

### Issue 4: "Lighting looks weird/artificial"

**Why it happens:**
- Light Boost was set too extreme (>+4 or <-4)
- Original lighting was inconsistent

**Solution:**
- Keep **Light Boost between -2 and +3**
- Use "Studio Lighting" preview (professionally balanced)
- Choose a preview that matches your intended style

---

### Issue 5: "Text/details look AI-generated"

**Why it happens:**
- Creativity was too high (AI "imagined" details)
- Image type is complex (mixed text + photo)

**Solution:**
- Set **Creativity to 0-1** for documents
- Use "Forensic Recovery" (safe, minimal changes)
- Avoid "Creative Reality" or "Max Sharpness"

## 🎓 Advanced Tips

### Tip 1: Layer Your Settings

Don't max out every slider. Instead:
1. Set **Creativity** based on image type (low for portraits, high for landscapes)
2. Set **Fractality** based on desired detail level
3. Only adjust **Light/Color Boost** if original needs help

**Good:** Creativity 4, Fractality 7, Light +1 (balanced)  
**Bad:** Creativity 10, Fractality 10, Light +5, Color +5 (overdone)

---

### Tip 2: Preview Tells You Everything

All 6 variations use the **same base settings** but different "creative directions." The best-looking preview is your answer.

- If preview #1 (Forensic) looks best → Image has damage to fix
- If preview #3 (Trend) looks best → Image benefits from artistic style
- If preview #6 (Max Sharpness) looks best → Image needs maximum detail

---

### Tip 3: Save Your Settings

If you find settings you like (e.g., "Creativity 4, Fractality 7, Light +2"), write them down. You can use the same for similar images.

---

### Tip 4: Use Batch Mode for Consistency

If you're upscaling multiple photos (e.g., product catalog, photo shoot):
1. Use the **same settings** for all images
2. Ensures consistent style across your collection
3. Professional results for galleries/portfolios
