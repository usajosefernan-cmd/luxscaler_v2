## 4. AI Services & Content - CRITICAL DISCLAIMERS

### 4.1 How LuxScaler Works (Technical Overview)

**LuxScaler uses multi-stage AI processing:**

1. **Analysis Stage:** AI analyzes your image to identify content type
2. **Preview Generation:** AI creates multiple enhanced variations with different artistic interpretations
3. **High-Resolution Upscaling:** AI generates final output at requested resolution (4K, 8K, etc.)

**Important Technical Details:**
- Processing uses **third-party AI models** from various providers
- AI models are **probabilistic and creative** — they interpret and enhance, not copy
- Each generation uses different parameters producing **unique variations**
- Processing may occur on servers in **multiple international locations**

### 4.2 AI Creative Freedom & Unpredictability

**CRITICAL: AI HAS CREATIVE LIBERTY**

LuxScaler's AI is designed to **enhance and improve** images, which means:

✗ **AI DOES NOT create pixel-perfect copies**  
✗ **AI MAY add, remove, or modify details** (textures, colors, objects)  
✗ **AI MAY change lighting, shadows, reflections**  
✗ **AI MAY enhance or alter facial features** (smoothing, sharpening, color correction)  
✗ **AI MAY "hallucinate" textures or patterns** not in the original  
✗ **AI MAY interpret ambiguous areas creatively**  

**Examples of AI Creative Behavior:**
- Adding realistic details to enhance photorealism
- Changing fabric textures or material properties
- Enhancing or softening skin tones, removing blemishes
- Adjusting color temperature or creating stylistic effects
- Adding reflections, highlights, or atmospheric effects
- Changing weather or lighting conditions
- Modifying facial expressions or proportions slightly

**This is INTENTIONAL and part of the "enhancement" process.**

### 4.3 Preview vs. Final Output Variance

**CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: PREVIEWS ARE NOT EXACT BLUEPRINTS**

**How it works:**
1. You upload an image
2. LuxScaler generates **AI preview variations** (lower resolution)
3. You select one preview you like
4. LuxScaler generates **high-resolution final version** (4K, 8K, etc.)

**⚠️ THE PROBLEM: The final output MAY NOT match the preview exactly.**

**Why variance occurs:**
- **Different AI processes:** Preview and final use separate AI generations
- **Resolution scaling:** Higher resolution reveals or adds different details
- **Creative interpretation:** AI may enhance differently at higher resolutions
- **Randomness:** AI uses probabilistic methods (not deterministic)
- **Hallucination:** AI may create new textures, patterns, or details

**Typical variance ranges:**
- **Color:** ±5-15% shift in hue/saturation/brightness
- **Details:** New textures, patterns, or objects may appear or change
- **Facial features:** ±5-10% variation in facial structure, skin tone, expression
- **Composition:** Minor shifts in positioning, cropping, or framing
- **Quality:** Artifacts, noise, or smoothing may differ

**WE CANNOT GUARANTEE:**
- ✗ Final output will match preview exactly
- ✗ Colors will be identical
- ✗ All details from preview will be preserved
- ✗ No new details will be added
- ✗ Facial features will remain unchanged

**WHAT YOU CAN DO:**
- ✓ Generate multiple times (costs additional credits)
- ✓ Request refund if result is completely unusable (see Section 6)
- ✓ Provide feedback to help us improve

**BY USING LUXSCALER, YOU ACCEPT THIS VARIANCE AS PART OF THE SERVICE.**

### 4.4 Resolution & Quality Disclaimers

**High-Resolution Output Specifications:**

**What we aim for:**
- Native high resolution (4K: ~3840×2160, 8K: ~7680×4320, or as specified)
- High quality encoding
- Preservation of fine details from AI generation

**What we CANNOT guarantee:**
- ✗ Exact pixel dimensions (may be slightly smaller/larger)
- ✗ No compression artifacts
- ✗ Lossless quality
- ✗ Perfect sharpness throughout entire image
- ✗ Consistency across multiple generations

**Technical limitations:**
- AI models have maximum resolution limits
- Large files may be compressed before processing to prevent failures
- Input images may be optimized before AI processing
- Output format and quality depend on AI capabilities
- Network issues may result in corrupted or incomplete downloads

**AI Resolution Behavior:**
- AI may generate at **lower resolution** than requested
- AI may generate at **different aspect ratios** than input
- AI may add **borders** or **crop** to fit target dimensions
- AI may **upscale internally** (interpolate) resulting in softer details

**YOU ACCEPT THAT:**
- Resolution targets (4K, 8K) are goals, not guarantees
- Actual resolution may vary ±20%
- Quality depends on input image, AI capabilities, and processing conditions

### 4.5 Inappropriate Content & Content Moderation

**Content Moderation Policy:**

**LuxScaler uses AI models with built-in safety filters to prevent generation of:**
- Pornographic or sexually explicit content
- Excessively violent or gory content
- Hateful, racist, or discriminatory content
- Child exploitation material (strictly prohibited)
- Illegal content (terrorism, drug manufacturing, etc.)

**⚠️ HOWEVER, SAFETY FILTERS ARE NOT PERFECT**

**What can happen:**
- **False negatives:** AI may occasionally generate inappropriate content despite filters
- **False positives:** Legitimate content (e.g., art, medical images) may be blocked
- **Contextual failures:** AI may misinterpret innocent content as inappropriate
- **Bypass vulnerabilities:** Determined users may find ways to evoke unwanted content

**Examples of AI mistakes:**
- Generating suggestive poses or partial nudity when not intended
- Adding violent elements (blood, weapons) to action scenes
- Misinterpreting anatomy (e.g., skin-colored clothing as nudity)
- Creating culturally insensitive or stereotypical representations

**OUR LIMITATIONS:**
- ✗ We do NOT manually review every generated image
- ✗ We CANNOT prevent all inappropriate outputs
- ✗ We DO NOT control third-party AI model safety filters
- ✗ We CANNOT predict all edge cases or vulnerabilities

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITY:**

**YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR:**
- ✓ Reviewing ALL outputs before sharing, publishing, or commercial use
- ✓ Ensuring outputs don't violate laws or third-party rights
- ✓ Not using LuxScaler to intentionally generate inappropriate content
- ✓ Reporting any inappropriate outputs to us immediately
- ✓ Deleting and not using inappropriate outputs

**OUR RESPONSE:**
- We will investigate reports of inappropriate content
- We may suspend/terminate accounts deliberately generating inappropriate content
- We will improve safety filters based on reported issues
- We are NOT LIABLE for inappropriate outputs generated by AI (see Section 9)

**IF YOU GENERATE INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT:**
- Delete it immediately
- Do not share, publish, or use it
- Report it to us at support@luxscaler.com
- Understand that repeated violations will result in account termination

### 4.6 Identity Preservation (Facial Recognition)

**For images containing human faces:**

**What LuxScaler attempts:**

- Controlled enhancement (skin smoothing, detail enhancement)
- Maintaining identity of individuals

**What we CANNOT guarantee:**
- ✗ Faces will remain 100% identical
- ✗ No changes to facial features, expressions, or skin tone
- ✗ Perfect preservation of identity in all cases

**Common facial changes AI may make:**
- Smoothing or sharpening skin texture
- Changing skin tone or lighting on face
- Slightly altering facial proportions (±5-10%)
- Modifying expressions (smiles, eye openness)
- Changing makeup, facial hair, or accessories
- Altering age appearance (making faces look younger/older)

**⚠️ CRITICAL FOR COMMERCIAL USE:**

**If you use LuxScaler for:**
- Professional headshots
- ID photos or official documents
- Medical/forensic purposes
